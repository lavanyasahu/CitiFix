🔹 Problem Statement in Simple Words

People see potholes, garbage dumps, broken streetlights etc., but their complaints either never reach the right authority OR get lost in bureaucracy.
Your system → lets users upload issue reports (photo + location + category), auto-classifies them, and forwards them to the right department for action.

🔹 Core Features You Can Implement (Simplified)

User Side (Mobile/Web App UI)

Register/Login (basic auth, or skip and allow anonymous reporting with phone/email).

Report Issue Form → Upload image + location (auto-fetch via GPS or manual pin on map) + category (dropdown: garbage/pothole/streetlight/etc.).

Track Status → Users can see if the issue is “Pending / In Progress / Resolved”.

Community View → Map/List of reported issues in their area.

Admin Side (Dashboard)

Department Login (e.g., municipal, electricity, roads).

Issue Assignment → Issues get auto-tagged and sent to the right admin, or they can be filtered manually.

Status Update → Admin marks issues as “in progress” or “resolved”.

Backend Logic

Store reports in a database (with photo, location, timestamp, status).

Tag issues with categories → simple dropdown now (later you can add AI auto-detection).

Map integration → Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for simplicity.

🔹 Tech Stack (2nd-Year Feasible)

Frontend (UI):

Mobile → Flutter (cross-platform, easy UI).

Web → React.js (clean, responsive).

Backend:

Node.js + Express (lightweight, easy APIs).

Firebase (if you want quick backend + authentication + database).

Database:

Firebase Firestore / Realtime DB (easy setup, reliable).

OR MySQL/PostgreSQL (if you want SQL experience).

Extras:

Google Maps API (location pinning).

Cloud Storage (Firebase Storage / AWS S3) for images.

🔹 Keep it Simple for Now

✅ Don’t overcomplicate with ML initially → just let the user choose category manually.
✅ Don’t build huge dashboards → a simple table-based admin UI works.
✅ Reliability comes from clean database design + easy UI, not from over-engineering.

🔹 Possible Workflow (Simplified Flow)

User opens app → clicks “Report Issue” → fills form → submits.

Data saved in DB → categorized by type.

Admin dashboard fetches new issues → shows them filtered by department.

Admin updates status → user gets notification.

🔹 What You Can Showcase in SIH

Feasible prototype → working end-to-end (report → DB → admin update → user status).

UI that’s clean & minimal → don’t overload with buttons, just main 3: Report, Track, Community.

Future Scope (just to impress judges): ML for auto-categorization, escalation mechanism if not resolved in X days, gamification (rewarding citizens for reporting).
